abstract: "We propose a new approach to localizing handle-like grasp affordances in 3-D point clouds. The main idea is to identify a set of sufficient geometric conditions for the existence of a grasp affordance and to search the point cloud for neighborhoods that satisfy these conditions. Our goal is not to find all possible grasp affordances, but instead to develop a method of localizing important types of grasp affordances quickly and reliably. The strength of this method relative to other current approaches is that it is very practical: it can have good precision/recall for the types of affordances under consideration, it runs in real-time, and it is easy to adapt to different robots and operating scenarios. We validate with a set of experiments where the approach is used to enable the Rethink Baxter robot to localize and grasp unmodelled objects."
